## ðŸš¨ About this repo (please read!)

You can use this code for your own website, but please with attribution\*\*.

Please note that the design of the website is inspired from "brittanychiang.com", but didn't copied even a single piece of code from brittanyching repo, However, i built the portfolio from scratch with different technolgoies, like "Tailwind CSS" and "Framer Motion" and i added some other functionalities to it, so it might seems the same, but believe me the entire website is different!!!!. If you have questions about implementation, please refer to the [Next.js DOCS](https://nextjs.org/docs) same thing for Tailwind CSS and Framer Motion check out the Documentation, Or you can simply reach to me directly.

## Description

Without a doubt a portfolio website is a unique way to showcase your work and let others know about yourself. Itâ€™s like an evergreen platform for your projects, case studies, and information about you. However, Why why did i choose Next.js? Because it is a React framework with Server-Side Rendering, which is good for SEO (Good for us if we get found on Google, right?).

Also, Next.js helps us build a full back-end & blazing-fast websites along with benefits such as Image optimization.

Why tailwindcss? Because TailwindCSS is a framework which reduces a lot of styling efforts. It has low level CSS classes that you can directly embed into the HTML code.
